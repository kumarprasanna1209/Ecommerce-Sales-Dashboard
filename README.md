## Problem Statement

The Ecommerce Sales and Profits dashboard aims to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of an ecommerce business. The primary objectives of this dashboard are:

Sales Analysis: Understanding sales trends over time, identifying top-selling products, and analyzing sales by region or category.

Profit Analysis: Analyzing profit margins, identifying profitable products or categories, and tracking profitability over time.

Performance Tracking: Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, and sales volume to assess the overall health of the business.
